•	4K Visualizer: A dynamic visualizer that represents the audio waveform in real-time.
•	Responsive Design: The layout is designed to be flexible and adjust to various screen sizes.
•	Autoplay Functionality: The audio starts playing automatically once an MP3 file is selected.
Technologies Used
•	HTML: The structure of the page is built using HTML.
•	CSS: Custom styling is used to create an aesthetic and user-friendly interface.
•	JavaScript: The audio player and visualizer functionality is handled using JavaScript, specifically the Web Audio API.
•	Canvas API: The visualizer uses the HTML5 Canvas API to draw the audio waveform in real-time.
